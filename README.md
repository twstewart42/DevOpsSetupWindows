# SYNOPSIS
Install and Setup DevOps Utilities that I routinely need on Windows/WSL based development platform...with a lot of help from Cowsay along the way

I got tired of repeating the same steps anytime I needed to start fresh on a new machine or get a new member on my team onboard. This takes a few hours of manual work down to a few minutes of casually waiting for things to work.

# DESCRIPTION
Installs git, WSL2, (scoop)[https://scoop.sh/], python3, docker desktop, VSC, Win Terminal, and more.  
Within WSL2/Ubuntu 20.04 configures and installs (ASDF)[https://asdf-vm.com/], (direnv)[https://direnv.net/], and all utilities necessary for DevOps/SRE work I typically engage in.   

# Prerequisite 
1. Install and configure Git For Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/
2. Clone this repo and run script
	
# Run

Open a User Level Powershell window
```pwsh
PS> .\windows-setup.ps1

That's It! Your computer is now set to checkout code and begin working.   
For the most part whether you enjoy working within Windows natively or in Linux the tooling is installed in both and you may use whatever assortment is comfortable for your workflow.
